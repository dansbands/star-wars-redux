## Star wars

This project was built for a code challenge. 
When I was asked to do it for a second time for a code challenge at a different company, I added Redux.

One of the requirements of the challenge is to only use the endpoints included in `src/utils/characters.json`
As a result, no films are retrieved for Obi-wan Kenobi.

To run the project locally, run `npm i && npm start`
